• N o Implied Rights: Nothing in these repositories grants any license, sublicense,
permission, or right-express, implied, statutory, o r otherwise—to view, access,
download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, display, transmit, o r otherwise use the
Works in any manner whatsoever without prior written authorization from an executive
officer o f NextEleven LLC.
• Automatic Protection: Protection attaches immediately upon creation, without need
for registration (though w e reserve the right t o register copyrights formally for
enhanced enforcement). As o f December 2025, U.S. copyright law provides for
statutory damages up t o $150,000 per willful infringement, and we will seek the
maximum in every case.
• Trade Secrets and Confidential Information: Any non-public elements, including but
not limited to source code, proprietary algorithms, business logic, or internal
documentation, are trade secrets under the Defend Trade Secrets Act o f 2016 (18
U.S.C. § 1839) and Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code § 134A). Misappropriation will trigger civil and criminal penalties,
including treble damages and attorneys' fees.
2. Prohibited Activities: A Comprehensive Blacklist
You are expressly forbidden from engaging i n any o f the following, directly o r indirectly,
anywhere i n the world:
• Copying o r Reproduction: Duplicating any part o f the Works, i n whole o r in part,
including but not limited to cloning repositories via Git, forking, mirroring, scraping,
screenshotting, photographing, or any other form of replication.
• Stealing or Misappropriation: Accessing, downloading, o r extracting the Works
without permission, including through automated tools, bots, APls, o r manual means.
This includes "inspiration" that results in substantially similar creations—we will pursue
derivative works a s infringements under 17 U.S.C. § 106.
• Cloning o r Forking: Creating any derivative, modified, o r adapted version o f the
Works, whether for personal, commercial, educational, o r any other use. Reverse
engineering, decompiling, disassembling, o r attempting t o derive source code is a
direct violation under the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions (17 U.S.C. § 1201),
punishable b y u p t o $500,000 in fines and 5 years imprisonment for first offenses.
• Distribution o r Sharing: Uploading, posting, emailing, linking, o r otherwise
disseminating the Works o r any portion thereof on any platform, including but not
limited t o other GitHub repos, GitLab, Bitbucket, SourceForge, personal websites,
social media, forums, cloud storage, or physical media.
• Public Performance o r Display: Demonstrating, showcasing, or integrating the Works
into any product, service, presentation, or public medium without explicit license.
• Commercial Exploitation: Using the Works i n any business, startup, app, software,
hardware, A l model training, o r revenue-generating activity. This includes indirect uses
like benchmarking or competitive analysis.
• Educational or Non-Profit Use: N o exemptions for "fair use" claims—we will contest
and litigate any asserted fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107, demanding proof o f
transformative nature, minimal portion used, and no market harm (which we assert is
always present).
• A l and Machine Learning: Feeding any Works into A l systems for training, generation,
or analysis constitutes theft and will be pursued as copyright infringement, consistent
with emerging case law as o f December 2025 (e.g., extensions o f Getty Images v.
Stability Al precedents).
• International Violations: If you are outside the U.S., we invoke the Universal Copyright
Convention, TRIPS Agreement (under WTO), and bilateral treaties t o enforce in your
jurisdiction. We will use long-arm statutes (e.g., Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code § 17.042) t o haul you into Texas courts.
Any attempt t o circumvent these prohibitions, including through VPNs, proxies,
anonymous accounts, o r offshore entities, will be treated as willful infringement, escalating
damages.
